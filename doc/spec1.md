Scenarios

Bobby is a 15 year old high school student. He enjoys playing Android games on his phone while he's goofing off in class. While browsing the Play Store one day,

Suzie is a 37 year old PhD. She's mentally exhausted and desperate to score a few points on her next Student Opinion Survey. Stumbling across a Web page demonstrating both the use of PongOut and the reams of score data it provides, she hastily scrribles together a quick lab exercise for her undergraduate Intro to Computing Class before falling asleep at her desk. The lab exercise is a hit with the students, who can both learn about basic Machine Learning algorithms and copy-paste the charts and graphs into their term papers to take up extra blank space.

Marketing Note
Try to find a cool playful comic book esque font.

The *New Game* screen allows the player to choose an opponent. The opponent can be either a second human player or algorithm. Algorithms have a name and a difficulty rating (in stars). Algorithms are not explained.
Once the player has chosen an opponent, play begins.

The *Gameplay* screen puts player 1 at the bottom and the opponent at the top.

Players can move their paddles and bounce the ball toward the procedurally generated bricks in the center.
