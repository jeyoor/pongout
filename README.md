PongOut
====

PongOut is a Unity3D playground for people and algorithms to compete in Pong

Getting Started
----
PongOut is delivered as a Unity Web Build.

To run PongOut, open the pongout_web_build folder and launch the HTML file with a Unity-compatible browser (such as IE or Firefox).

Start Screen
----

From the start screen, you can pick how the players will be controlled and start the game by clicking the "Start Game" button.

   * Manual control is provided via the keyboard (Player 1 uses the Arrow Keys, Player 2 uses WASD).
   * The "linear follow" algorithm moves the center of the paddle toward the current position of the ball with a maximum velocity of 3.
   * The "fast linear follow" algorithm moves the center of the paddle toward the the current position of the ball with a maximum velocity of 6.

Gameplay
----

Break the bricks to get points, and try to get the ball past your opponent.

After all the bricks are destroyed, they will regenerate and the ball will bounce faster.

Try to get the highest score you can!
